# TUDelft/EDxROS_Course
Hello (Real) World with ROS â€“ Robot Operating System
This repo follows the [course] (https://www.edx.org/es/course/hello-real-world-with-ros-robot-operating-system) provided by TUDelft university 

Most of the code was made by TUDelft

## Course outline
Week 0: Course setup
Installation of Ubuntu-Linux, course simulation setup and supporting software.

Week 1: ROS Essentials
Introduction to ROS Topics, Services, Actions, and Nodes. Simple interaction with the course simulation environment.

Week 2: Build your own robot environment
Software representation of a Robot using Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), ROS parameter server and adding real-world object representations to the simulation environment.

Week 3: Autonomous Navigation
Map creation with GMapping package, autonomously navigate a known map with ROS navigation.

Week 4: Manipulation
Motion planning, pick and place behaviors using industrial robots with ROS MoveIt!

Week 5: Robot Vision
Object detection, pose estimation.

Week 6: Final Project
ROS file system, basic concepts of behavior design with state machines, build a production line application with two industrial robot arms and a mobile robot. 

## Course summary
In this course, you will learn to use different ROS tools to create a complete robotic application. You will be working with your own standalone Ubuntu-Linux installation and with industrial and mobile robots on the physics-based simulation engine, Gazebo. You will learn to program and configure basic robotic tasks such as pick-and-place objects, and navigate through obstacles. You will then integrate all this knowledge to build an industrial production line with two robotic arms and a mobile robot.
